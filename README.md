# Mitopredictor
This is a Shiny app that predicts if a protein is mitochondrial or not from its sequence. To build this app, I trained a random forest model using human protein data from Uniprot and Mitocarta.

# To use the app, enter the following command in R
runGitHub( "Mitopredictor", "BAREJAA")
